# How to measure your microscope’s HPF. 
## A critical guide for residents.

## This paper
Counting _stuff_ under the microscope is part of the duties of a surgical pathologist. Many textbooks and articles still report the surface area as the number of  high-power fields (HPFs) counted. This is bad, since the area displayed by an HPF varies  between two microscopes. It is therefore necessary to express the surface as mm<sup>2</sup>.This is a _how to_ guide written for the resident that has to measure the HPF of the microscope for the first time. The _Resident_ can either calibrate the microscope with a stage micrometer slide (a small ruler on a glass slide) or compute the surface area of the HPF using the numbers on the eyepiece and the magnification objective: for  "10X/22" eyepiece and a "40X" objective, the diameter of the HPF is 22/40=0.55 mm (if no other magnification is present), and the surface is 0.238 mm<sup>2</sup>. The young resident might then ask: _"How far off-target  was I when I counted the number of HPFs that the chief resident declared to be correct?"_ Probably not that much: although legitimate in principle and correct in math, the size of the problem is often overstated since microscopes are not that different after all and because pathology is not just about counting.
