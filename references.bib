abstract = {Mitoses are often assessed by pathologists to assist the diagnosis of cancer, and to grade malignancy, informing prognosis. Historically, this has been done by expressing the number of mitoses per n high power fields (HPFs), ignoring the fact that microscope fields may differ substantially, even at the same high power (×400) magnification. Despite a requirement to define HPF size in scientific papers, many authors fail to address this issue adequately. The problem is compounded by the switch to digital pathology systems, where ×400 equivalent fields are rectangular and also vary in the area displayed. The potential for error is considerable, and at times this may affect patient care. This is easily solved by the use of standardized international (SI) units. We, therefore, recommend that features such as mitoses are always counted per mm2, with an indication of the area to be counted and the method used (usually “hotspot” or “average”) to obtain the results.},

@article{Gal2005,
abstract = {Mitosis counting remains one of the most valuable prognostic indicators in tumor pathology; however, as currently carried out it is time consuming and not reproducible. In this study, 6 different pathologists, using different microscopes, arrived at widely different mitotic counts on the same slide, ranging from 4 to 16. These differences were mainly due to the different field areas of the various microscopes used and the method used for counting and recording. In evaluating the most active 10 HPF, the count ranged from 10 to 19. Instead, when an average of 40 fields was recorded, the range was 4-11. Using the mitosis/volume index, which expresses the number of mitotic figures per mm 2 of viable tumor, the counts ranged from 8 to 10, a marked improvement. However, this method is complicated and not “user-friendly.” We suggest a variation of the technique by which a 2 mm 2 rectangle is drawn on a cover slip and mounted under the microscope, centered on the most mitotically active area of the tumor. The mitoses in that area are counted (=n) and the percent of viable tumor (=x%) is estimated under low magnification. The number of mitoses per mm 2 of viable tumor (cs-MAI) is then calculated according to the formula Cs-MAI=100n/2x. Using this modified method, the range of mitoses counted by the different observers was very narrow (9 to 11), and the time required for the counting was only 5-10 minutes.},

abstract = {The number of mitotic figures in a predefined area is essential in pathologic evaluation for most tumors. This information sometimes provides clues in differentiating neoplastic lesions from nonneoplastic ones and sometimes in defining and grading of the tumors as well as prognosticating expected lifetime of the patient. As a generally accepted concept, scanning a certain number of consecutive nonoverlapping areas that are rich in viable tumor cells is required. Invasion fronts or the periphery of the tumors is preferred for counting mitosis. The target area to be counted for mitotic activity for various tumors is standardized as the number of mitosis in an established number of high-power fields. However, suggested mitotic counts, which constitute the basis of these studies, were obtained via the old microscopes, which usually had narrower visual fields than the state-of-the-art microscopes. Because the visual fields of the present microscopes provide larger areas compared with the older ones, corrections in mitosis counting are needed to make them compatible with the criteria, which had been put forward in the original reference studies. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate to what extent mitotic activity index assessments are influenced by tumour heterogeneity. Ten invasive breast carcinomas of varying size were completely embedded, yielding 2-7 paraffin blocks per tumour. From each block, three H and E stained skip sections were cut and, in all sections, the mitotic activity index (MAI) and the mitoses per volume (M/V-)index were assessed. Coefficients of variation were calculated for the three different sampling levels (tumours, blocks, sections). In addition we recorded in how many tumours threshold discrepancies (values on both sides of the prognostic thresholds) occurred. Nested analysis of variance showed that most of the total variance occurred between the tumours. Threshold discrepancies occurred in four (40%) and five tumours (50%) for mitotic activity index and the mitoses per volume index, respectively. However, when grouping all sections from the same tumour and subjectively selecting the one showing the highest proliferation, the section with the highest mitotic activity was selected in nine of the 10 cases. In the other single case a prognostically correct value was still obtained. Thus, there is a noteworthy intra-tumour heterogeneity in mitotic activity in invasive breast cancer. We therefore propose the need to take multiple blocks per tumour and carefully scan all sections for the highest proliferative area.},

We assessed prognostic factors of patients with operable GIST, to compare widely used risk-stratification schemes and to develop a new method for risk estimation. Methods: Population-based cohorts of patients diagnosed with operable GIST, who were not given adjuvant therapy, were identified from the literature. Data from ten series and 2560 patients were pooled. Risk of tumour recurrence was stratified using the National Institute of Health (NIH) consensus criteria, the modified consensus criteria, and the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) criteria. Prognostic factors were examined using proportional hazards and non-linear models. The results were validated in an independent centre-based cohort consisting of 920 patients with GIST. Findings: Estimated 15-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) after surgery was 59{\textperiodcentered}9% (95% CI 56{\textperiodcentered}2-63{\textperiodcentered}6); few recurrences occurred after the first 10 years of follow-up. Large tumour size, high mitosis count, non-gastric location, presence of rupture, and male sex were independent adverse prognostic factors. In receiver operating characteristics curve analysis of 10-year RFS, the NIH consensus criteria, modified consensus criteria, and AFIP criteria resulted in an area under the curve (AUC) of 0{\textperiodcentered}79 (95% CI 0{\textperiodcentered}76-0{\textperiodcentered}81), 0{\textperiodcentered}78 (0{\textperiodcentered}75-0{\textperiodcentered}80), and 0{\textperiodcentered}82 (0{\textperiodcentered}80-0{\textperiodcentered}85), respectively. The modified consensus criteria identified a single high-risk group. Since tumour size and mitosis count had a non-linear association with the risk of GIST recurrence, novel prognostic contour maps were generated using non-linear modelling of tumour size and mitosis count, and taking into account tumour site and rupture. The non-linear model accurately predicted the risk of recurrence (AUC 0{\textperiodcentered}88, 0{\textperiodcentered}86-0{\textperiodcentered}90). Interpretation: The risk-stratification schemes assessed identify patients who are likely to be cured by surgery alone. Although the modified NIH classification is the best criteria to identify a single high-risk group for consideration of adjuvant therapy, the prognostic contour maps resulting from non-linear modelling are appropriate for estimation of individualised outcomes.

abstract = {Gastrointestinal (GI) stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal tumors specific to the GI tract, generally defined as KIT (CD117)-positive tumors with a characteristic set of histologic features. These tumors, derived from Cajal cells or their precursors, most commonly occur at the age >50 years in the stomach (60%), jejunum and ileum (30%), duodenum (4-5%), rectum (4%), colon and appendix (1-2%), and esophagus (<1%), and rarely as apparent primary extragastrointestinal tumors in the vicinity of stomach or intestines. Their overall incidence has been estimated as 10 to 20 per million, including incidental minimal tumors. GISTs are rare in children (<1%) and almost exclusively occur in stomach. They are common in patients with neurofibromatosis 1, who have a predisposition to (multiple) small intestinal GISTs. GISTs contain a spectrum from minute indolent tumors to sarcomas at all sites of occurrence. Their gross patterns are diverse, including nodular, cystic, and diverticular tumors. External involvement of pancreas and liver can simulate primary tumor in these organs. In general, gastric tumors have a more favorable prognosis than the intestinal ones with similar parameters. Gastric GISTs ≤10 cm and ≤5 mitoses per 50 HPFs have a low risk for metastasis, whereas those with >5 per 50 HPFs and >5 cm in diameter have a high risk for metastasis. In contrast, all intestinal GISTs >5 cm independent of mitotic rate have at least moderate risk for metastases, and all >5 mitoses per 50 HPFs have a high risk for metastases. Intestinal GISTs ≤5 cm with ≤5 mitoses per 50 HPFs have a low risk for metastases. Gastric GISTs can be divided into histologic subgroups including 4 spindle cell and 4 epithelioid variants. Intestinal GISTs are a histologically more homogeneous group and often contain distinctive extracellular collagen globules, skeinoid fibers. Immunohistochemical demonstration of KIT, CD34, or protein kinase theta positivity helps to properly identify these tumors. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are mesenchymal tumors usually driven by the mutational activation of receptor tyrosine kinases, KIT, or PDGFRA. Oncogenic activation of phosphatidylinositide-3-kinase (PI3K), a downstream effector in the KIT signaling pathway, has been identified in different types of cancer, with the PI3K 110[alpha] subunit encoded by PIK3CA being a common mutational target. In this study, the mutational hotspot in the PIK3CA kinase domain encoded by exon 20 was evaluated in 529 imatinib-naive GISTs using PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing. Eight mutations (two co-existing in one tumor) were identified. Subsequently, The cobas PIK3CA Mutation Test was employed to evaluate mutational hotspots in exons 1, 4, 7, and 9 in 119 PIK3CA exon 20-wild type tumors. In two cases, mutations in exons 1 and 9 were identified. In one GIST, previously undetected by Sanger sequencing, the exon 20 mutation was discovered. Altogether, eight primary and two metastatic GISTs carried PIK3CA mutations. The size of primary PIK3CA-mutant GISTs was [ge]14[thinsp]cm (mean size 17[thinsp]cm), and mitotic activity varied from 0 to 72 per 50HPF (mean 5/50HPF). Follow-up data showed short survival in 6 of 7 studied cases. Detection of PIK3CA mutations in large or metastatic KIT-mutant GISTs may suggest that PIK3CA-mutant clones have a proliferative advantage during disease progression. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been successfully used in GIST treatment. However, resistance frequently develops due to secondary KIT mutations or activation of downstream to KIT signaling pathways, such as the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. PIK3CA mutations similar to the ones detected in GISTs have been shown to cause such activation. Therefore, genotyping of PIK3CA in GISTs might help to pinpoint primary and metastatic tumors with the potential to develop resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors and guide therapy with PI3K inhibitors.},

The aim of this work is to perform a wide comprehensive genomic study on quadruple WT GIST to improve the characterization of these patients. We selected 14 clinical cases of quadruple WT GIST, of which nine cases showed sufficient DNA quality for Whole Exome Sequencing (WES). NF1 alterations were identified directly by WES. Gene expression from Whole Transcriptome Sequencing (WTS) and miRNA profiling were performed using fresh-frozen, quadruple WT GIST tissue specimens and compared to SDH and KIT/PDGFRA- mutant GIST. WES identified an average of 18 somatic mutations per sample. The most relevant somatic oncogenic mutations identified were in TP53, MEN1, MAX, FGF1R, CHD4 and CTDNN2. No somatic alterations in NF1 were identified in the analyzed cohort. A total of 247 mRNA transcripts and 66 miRs were differentially expressed specifically in quadruple WT GIST. Overexpression of specific molecular markers (COL22A1, CALCRL) and genes involved in neural and neuroendocrine lineage (ASCL1, Family B GPCRs) were detected and further supported by predicted miRNA target analysis. Quadruple WT GIST show a specific genetic signature that deviates significantly from that of KIT/PDGFRA-mutant and SDH-mutant GIST. Mutations in MEN1 and MAX genes, a neural-committed phenotype and up-regulation of the master neuroendocrine regulator ASCL1, support a genetic similarity with neuroendocrine tumors, with whom they share also the great variability in oncogenic driver genes.},

abstract = {Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) are mesenchymal neoplasms that arise in the gastrointestinal tract, usually in the stomach or the small intestine and rarely elsewhere in the abdomen. They can occur at any age, the median age being 60-65 years, and typically cause bleeding, anaemia, and pain. GISTs have variable malignant potential, ranging from small lesions with a benign behaviour to fatal sarcomas. Most tumours stain positively for the mast/stem cell growth factor receptor KIT and anoctamin 1 and harbour a kinase-activating mutation in either KIT or PDGFRA. Tumours without such mutations could have alterations in genes of the succinate dehydrogenase complex or in BRAF, or rarely RAS family genes. About 60% of patients are cured by surgery. Adjuvant treatment with imatinib is recommended for patients with a substantial risk of recurrence, if the tumour has an imatinib-sensitive mutation. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors substantially improve survival in advanced disease, but secondary drug resistance is common.},

@article{Wang2021,
abstract = {Context.-Mitotic rate counting is essential in pathologic evaluations in melanoma. The American Joint Committee on Cancer recommends reporting the number of mitotic figures (MFs) in a 1-mm2 area encompassing the ''hot spot.'' There is currently no standard procedure for delineating a 1-mm2 region of interest for MF counting on a digital whole slide image (WSI) of melanoma. Objective.-To establish a standardized method to enclose a 1-mm2 region of interest for MF counting in melanoma based on WSIs and assess the method's effectiveness. Design.-Whole slide images were visualized using the ImageScope viewer (Aperio). Different monitors and viewing magnifications were explored and the annotation tools provided by ImageScope were evaluated. For validation, we compared mitotic rates obtained from WSIs with our method and those from glass slides with traditional microscopy with 30 melanoma cases. Results.-Of the monitors we examined, a 32-inch monitor with 3840 3 2160 resolution was optimal for counting MFs within a 1-mm2 region of interest in melanoma. When WSIs were viewed in the ImageScope viewer, 310 to 320 magnification during screening could efficiently locate a hot spot and 320 to 340 magnification during counting could accurately identify MFs. Fixed-shape annotations with 500 3 500-lm squares or circles can precisely and efficiently enclose a 1-mm2 region of interest. Our method on WSIs was able to produce a higher mitotic rate than with glass slides. Conclusions.-Whole slide images may be used to efficiently count MFs. We recommend fixed-shape annotation with 500 3 500-lm squares or circles for routine practice in counting MFs for melanoma.},

@article{Tabata2019,
abstract = {Background: The establishment of whole-slide imaging (WSI) as a medical diagnostic device allows that pathologists may evaluate mitotic activity with this new technology. Furthermore, the image digitalization provides an opportunity to develop algorithms for automatic quantifications, ideally leading to improved reproducibility as compared to the naked eye examination by pathologists. In order to implement them effectively, accuracy of mitotic figure detection using WSI should be investigated. In this study, we aimed to measure pathologist performance in detecting mitotic figures (MFs) using multiple platforms (multiple scanners) and compare the results with those obtained using a brightfield microscope. Methods: Four slides of canine oral melanoma were prepared and digitized using 4 WSI scanners. In these slides, 40 regions of interest (ROIs) were demarcated, and five observers identified the MFs using different viewing modes: microscopy and WSI. We evaluated the inter- and intra-observer agreements between modes with Cohen's Kappa and determined "true" MFs with a consensus panel. We then assessed the accuracy (agreement with truth) using the average of sensitivity and specificity. Results: In the 40 ROIs, 155 candidate MFs were detected by five pathologists; 74 of them were determined to be true MFs. Inter- and intra-observer agreement was mostly "substantial" or greater (Kappa = 0.594-0.939). Accuracy was between 0.632 and 0.843 across all readers and modes. After averaging over readers for each modality, we found that mitosis detection accuracy for 3 of the 4 WSI scanners was significantly less than that of the microscope (p = 0.002, 0.012, and 0.001). Conclusions: This study is the first to compare WSIs and microscopy in detecting MFs at the level of individual cells. Our results suggest that WSI can be used for mitotic cell detection and offers similar reproducibility to the microscope, with slightly less accuracy.},

@article{Balkenhol2019,
abstract = {As part of routine histological grading, for every invasive breast cancer the mitotic count is assessed by counting mitoses in the (visually selected) region with the highest proliferative activity. Because this procedure is prone to subjectivity, the present study compares visual mitotic counting with deep learning based automated mitotic counting and fully automated hotspot selection. Two cohorts were used in this study. Cohort A comprised 90 prospectively included tumors which were selected based on the mitotic frequency scores given during routine glass slide diagnostics. This pathologist additionally assessed the mitotic count in these tumors in whole slide images (WSI) within a preselected hotspot. A second observer performed the same procedures on this cohort. The preselected hotspot was generated by a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained to detect all mitotic figures in digitized hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) sections. The second cohort comprised a multicenter, retrospective TNBC cohort (n = 298), of which the mitotic count was assessed by three independent observers on glass slides. The same CNN was applied on this cohort and the absolute number of mitotic figures in the hotspot was compared to the averaged mitotic count of the observers. Baseline interobserver agreement for glass slide assessment in cohort A was good (kappa 0.689; 95% CI 0.580–0.799). Using the CNN generated hotspot in WSI, the agreement score increased to 0.814 (95% CI 0.719–0.909). Automated counting by the CNN in comparison with observers counting in the predefined hotspot region yielded an average kappa of 0.724. We conclude that manual mitotic counting is not affected by assessment modality (glass slides, WSI) and that counting mitotic figures in WSI is feasible. Using a predefined hotspot area considerably improves reproducibility. Also, fully automated assessment of mitotic score appears to be feasible without introducing additional bias or variability.},

@article{Tran2015,
abstract = {Given the importance of correctly staging renal cell carcinomas, specific guidelines should be in place for tumor size measurement. While a standard means of renal tumor measurement has not been established, intuitively, tumor size should be based on fresh measurements. We sought to assess the accuracy of postfixation and microscopic measurements of renal tumor size, as compared to fresh measurements and radiographic size. Thirty-four nephrectomy cases performed by a single surgeon were prospectively measured at different time points. The study cases included 23 clear cell renal cell carcinomas, 6 papillary renal cell carcinomas, and 5 other renal tumors. Radiologic tumors were 12.1% larger in diameter than fresh tumors (P < 0.01). Furthermore, fresh specimens were 4.6% larger than formalin-fixed specimens (P < 0.01), and postfixation measurements were 7.1% greater than microscopic measurements (P < 0.01). The overall mean percentage of shrinkage between fresh and histological specimens was 11.4% (P < 0.01). Histological processing would cause a tumor stage shift from pT1b to pT1a for two tumors in this study. The shrinkage effects of formalin fixation and histological processing may result in understaging of renal cell carcinomas. The shrinkage factor should be considered when reporting tumor size.},

The procedure essentially involves the construction of functions of the observed proportions which are directed at the extent to which the observers agree among themselves and the construction of test statistics for hypotheses involving these functions. Tests for interobserver bias are presented in terms of first-order marginal homogeneity and measures of interobserver agreement are developed as generalized kappa-type statistics. These procedures are illustrated with a clinical diagnosis example from the epidemiological literature.},
